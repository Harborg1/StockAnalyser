# StockAnalyser

This application allows users to get an overview of how a stock has performed on a monthly baisis. The stocks I have selected to track are those that I follow personally.
To use the application, clone the repository and open a code editor. 
Navigate to the app.py file, open a terminal and run the program. Then, select a stock and the month you want to see data for.
Users can download a .pdf of the monthly data with the download button and fetch relevant news with the fetch news button.
