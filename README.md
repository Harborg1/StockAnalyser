# StockAnalyser

This application allows users to get an overview of how a stock has performed on a monthly baisis. 
The stocks I have selected to track are those that I follow personally.
To use the application, clone the repository from Github and open a code editor. 
Then navigate to the StockMarketData folder and open it.
Then open a terminal and run the app.py file. This will display a simple User Interface.
Then, select a stock and the month you want to see data for.
Users can download a .pdf of the monthly data with the download button and fetch relevant news with the fetch news button.
